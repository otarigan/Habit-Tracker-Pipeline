# Habit-Tracker-Pipeline
The following Python code initiates a GUI in which habits and its corresponding progress can be tracked. The purpose of this project is to create a useful assistant in organizing and tracking a person's personal goals. By entering it into the code, the progress can then be transformed through SQL operations and visualized on Looker. A pipeline performing the transformations will also be set up.

I wanted to focus on building a habit tracker app which motivates users by showing daily progress, and making it as satisfying as possible when achieving their goals!
